# Tetris in Python


Second game to commit, this time tetris in Python using the pygame module. Still incomplete, but the base game works.
Play using arrow keys to move the blocks, and A/D to rotate.

Still to do : 
- bigger field in order to show gui elements
- scoring + showing the score
- black border around all the blocks
- In game instructions for how to play (keyboard bindings)
- A pause state
