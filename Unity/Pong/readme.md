# Pong in Unity


First game to commit, just simple pong. Later, when I get a bit better at this, will attempt to add more functionality like
- two player mode
- different difficulties
- 4 player mode (why not, sounds awfull, but lets give it a try)
- Powerups
- Tournament mode for multiple players
